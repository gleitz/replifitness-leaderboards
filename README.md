# Club Leaderboard Data Pulled From Strava

Code to pull out the leaderboard contents from Strava clubs - not available through Strava API currently

The code will output two CSV files, this weeks leaderboard and last weeks leaderboard. Currently the code works for three clubs:

* [Hiscox LM Virtual Running Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/HiscoxLM)
* [Hiscox U.K. Virtual WFH Running Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/hiscox-u-k-virtual-wfh-running-club-598151)
* [Runners of HiscoxRe](https://www.strava.com/clubs/runners-of-hiscoxre-598340)


NOTE - This code needs to be run once a week to pull the weekly leaderboard
